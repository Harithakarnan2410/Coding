/* Prob 2: Write a program to check whether a triangle can be formed with the given values for the angles.

If sum of angles is equal to 180, then triangle can be formed, else it can't be formed.

Input: 45 45 45

Expected Output: 

Triangle cannot be formed

Explanation -> We are getting 3 inputs, that is three angles of triangle, but here the sum of three angles that is 45+45+45 is not equal to 180 so Triangle cannot be formed is the output./*

        int num=scan.nextInt();
        int num1=scan.nextInt();
        int num2=scan.nextInt();
        int c=num+num1+num2;
